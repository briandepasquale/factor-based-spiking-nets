# factor-based-spiking-nets

Demos for training recurrent spiking networks, as described in `Building spiking network models from latent factors provides conceptual insight into neural circuit function`

Demos were tested and successfully executed 07-30-2021 on MATLAB 2016a.

## Cycling

Train a spiking network to generate the cycling factors. The cycling factors and emg outputs are provided.

## Reaching 

Train a spikng network to perform the reaching task. The reaching emg outputs are provided, and code is provided to derive the factors from a rate-based model.

## Contextual Integration

Train a spiking network to perform the contextual integration task. A backprop trained rate network for generating the factors is already provided.
