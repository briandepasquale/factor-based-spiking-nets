# Factor-based Spiking Networks

Demos for training recurrent spiking networks, as described in `The centrality of population-level factors to network computation is demonstrated by a versatile approach for training spiking networks`.

Demos were tested and successfully executed 05-15-2022 on MATLAB 2016a&b and MATLAB 2021b.

## Cycling

Train a spiking network to generate the cycling factors. The cycling factors and emg outputs are provided.

## Reaching 

Train a spikng network to perform the reaching task. The reaching emg outputs are provided, and code is provided to derive the factors from a rate-based model.

## Contextual Integration

Train a spiking network to perform the contextual integration task. A backprop trained rate network for generating the factors is already provided.

## Cycling-reaching (two-task network)

Train a spiking network to perform the cycling task and the reaching task. The cycling factors and emg outputs are provided. The reaching emg outputs are provided, and code is provided to derive the factors from a rate-based model.

## Factor-based firing rate

Example of computing the factor based rate using cycling task factors.
