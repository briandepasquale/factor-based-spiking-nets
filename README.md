# factor-based-spiking-nets

Demos for training recurrent spiking networks, as described in `Building spiking network models from latent factors provides conceptual insight into neural circuit function`

## Cycling

Train a spiking network to generate the cycling factors.

## Reaching 

Train a spikng network to perform the reaching task.

## Contextual Integration

Train a spiking network to perform the contextual integration task. A backprop trained rate network is already provided.
